## Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for Amazon. It includes information such as date, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building the prediction model, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This step involves analyzing the data's statistical properties, visualizing trends, and identifying patterns or outliers.

## LSTM Model
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for time series prediction tasks. In this project, an LSTM model is constructed to learn from the historical stock price data and make predictions.

## Training
The LSTM model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves feeding the model with historical stock price sequences and optimizing its parameters to minimize the prediction error.

## Evaluation
After training, the LSTM model is evaluated using a test dataset to assess its performance. Various evaluation metrics are used to measure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Making Predictions
Once the LSTM model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on unseen or future stock price data. These predictions can provide insights for potential investors or traders.
